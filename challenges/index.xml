      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m 29 year old now, I has been working as a software engineer for more than seven years. And you know; this is my third company that I&amp;rsquo;m been working during my whole career, I got some quite interviews still now. I had to admit that I&amp;rsquo;m not a really good software engineer, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a deep knowledge to what I&amp;rsquo;m been working on. One reason would be impatience and didn&amp;rsquo;t spend more time on researching things.</description>
