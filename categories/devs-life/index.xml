      <description>When considering where to live in Vietnam, it is important to define what makes a place &amp;ldquo;worth living&amp;rdquo;. Nowadays, remote work is more feasible, especially for software programmers like me. So for me, a worth living place is one that is easy to get around, affordable for living, and offers plenty of opportunities to immerse oneself in nature.&#xA;Criteria Walking condition If you love to walk, Vietnam can be challenging place to live.</description>

      <description>Motivation First contribution to an open-source is the significant milestone in my journey as a software engineer, it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to learn and give back to the community.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m currently working for Gridly, which is a content management and localization system. Gridly has a feature called Connector and it uses Airbyte internally for syncing data from other sources to Gridly.&#xA;Airbyte Gridly connector So, I decided to write Gridly as a source connector to sync data to other destinations.</description>

      <description>Language learning has always been a challenge for me, even with my native Vietnamese. Despite years of studying English, I still find myself working hard to improve.&#xA;No, the paragraph above is not my original one. It&amp;rsquo;s the version from Gemini.&#xA;And my second one as well.&#xA;And &amp;hellip;&#xA;But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter now. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start a blog to practice my writing. As a software engineer, I believe it will help me deepen my technical knowledge and build a personal portfolio.</description>
