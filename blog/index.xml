      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s character encoding? Words and sentenses are created from characters. Those characters are stored in computers in bytes.
Basically, you can visuallize by assuming all characters are stored in computer using a special code. A character encoding provides a key to unlock the code. It is set of a mappings between bytes in computers and the characters in character set. Without key, the data looks like garbage.

      <description>Go is statically typed, complied programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer (V8 engine, Java Hotspt VM), Rob Pike (Unix Team, UTF-8) and Ken Tompson (Unix).

 Did the C++ committee really believe that what was wrong with C++ was that it didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough features?

Robert: Starting point: C, fix some obvious flaws, remove crud, add a few missing features.</description>
