      <description>When considering where to live in Vietnam, it is important to define what makes a place &amp;ldquo;worth living&amp;rdquo;. Nowadays, remote work is more feasible, especially for software programmers like me. So for me, a worth living place is one that is easy to get around, affordable for living, and offers plenty of opportunities to immerse oneself in nature.
Criteria Walking condition If you love to walk, Vietnam can be challenging place to live.</description>

      <description>Motivation First contribution to an open-source is the significant milestone in my journey as a software engineer, it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to learn and give back to the community.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently working for Gridly, which is a content management and localization system. Gridly has a feature called Connector and it uses Airbyte internally for syncing data from other sources to Gridly.
Airbyte Gridly connector So, I decided to write Gridly as a source connector to sync data to other destinations.</description>

And my second one as well.
And &amp;hellip;
But they doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter though, what matters now is that I have decided to start to write a blog.
