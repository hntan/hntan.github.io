      <description>First contribution to an open-source is the significant milestone in my journey as a software engineer, it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to learn and give back to the community.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently working for Gridly, which is a content management and localization system. Gridly has a feature called Connector and it uses Airbyte internally for syncing data from other sources to Gridly.
So I dicided to write Gridly as a source connector, to sync data from Gridly to other destinations.</description>
