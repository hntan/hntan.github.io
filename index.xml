      <description>Motivation First contribution to an open-source is the significant milestone in my journey as a software engineer, it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to learn and give back to the community.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently working for Gridly, which is a content management and localization system. Gridly has a feature called Connector and it uses Airbyte internally for syncing data from other sources to Gridly.
Airbyte Gridly connector So, I decided to write Gridly as a source connector to sync data to other destinations.</description>

And &amp;hellip;
But they doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter though, what matters now is that I have decided to start to write a blog.
