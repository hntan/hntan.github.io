      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m 29 year old now, I has been working as a software engineer for more than seven years. And you know; this is my third company that I&amp;rsquo;m been working during my whole career, I got some quite interviews still now. I had to admit that I&amp;rsquo;m not a really good software engineer, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a deep knowledge to what I&amp;rsquo;m been working on. One reason would be impatience and didn&amp;rsquo;t spend more time on researching things.</description>

A poem by Thich Nhat Hanh Promise me,
promise me this day,
promise me now,
while the sun is overhead
exactly at the zenith,
promise me:
Even as they
strike you down
with a mountain of hatred and violence;
even as they step on you and crush you
like a worm,
even as they dismember and disembowel you,
remember brother, remember:
man is not our enemy.</description>

      <description>Relationships don&amp;rsquo;t survive because two people don&amp;rsquo;t hurt each other, they survive because two people work to maintain connection. Humans are hard-wired to connect. Just google &amp;ldquo;wired to connect&amp;rdquo; for plenty of literary works on the subject. Connection allows our relationships to survive the inevitable damage we do to each other, whether inadvertent or not.
&amp;ndash; Joe (joe@thinkster.io) &amp;ndash;
 Below is the whole email got from Joe.
There is a universal law of being human, and being around other people (whether physically or virtually): you will hurt them.</description>
